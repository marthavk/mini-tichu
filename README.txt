This project is an applet of one round of the game of mini-tichu. 
When running the applet 2 options are possible: 
-Observation of the game, in order to see how artificial players react
-Play as one of the 4 players. Then the user has one AI team-mate and one team of 2 AI players as opponents.

By changing the player#config.properties file the parameters of the players can be changed 
(this results to different kind of behaviors)

This project is not for commercial purpose

Also: The file miglayout-3.5.5-swing must be added to the build path if not recognized

Instructions for the Tichu game can be found here
